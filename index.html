		'<p>2013-02-16 ~ There were not many comments on data globe #2, so data globe #3 took off. Fasten your seat belts. ' +
		'Our friend Geoff who lives in Antony outside of Paris writes add-ons for <a href="http://www.flightgear.org/" target="_blank">FlightGear</a> ' +
		'- a free, open source software flight simulator. A particularly nice utility service he helps provide (along with the flight crew at ' +
		'<a href="http://www.fgx.ch/" target="_blank">FGX</a>) is real-time notification of who is in the air and where. ' +
		'So the goal became to take this live text data and show it on our data globe.' +
		'</p>' +
		
		'<p>Development so far has been quick and easy. The first test flight occurred well within the first day of construction. So far there was only one big crash - ' +
		'where a browser session had to be killed. Airplane positions as well as the text placards are being updated every ten seconds with few issues. ' +
		'There is still work to be done: For the moment, the rotation angle (or heading) of the plane is a broken kluge. ' +
		'The fix will involve figuring out the best way to carry out the matrix multiplication. After that it might be nice to display tiny models of the planes being flown. ' +
		'And after that there\'s still a ton more that could be done - from showing the satellite images of the current cloud cover using data from ' +
		' <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/" target="_blank">Weather Underground</a> ' +
		'to adding the ability to communicate with the pilots to making the bland white ribbon currently under the planes look like real sky writing ' +
		' - and enabling pilots to choose their preferred color. And. of course, there are still resource-hogging issues going on as well. Welcome to the <s>real</s> ' +
		' rotating world.' +

		'<p>No matter how much \'eye-candy\' this particular implementation of a data globe may provide, it\'s important to remember that this is only ' +
		'a small step towards building a useful and informative data globe...</p>' +
		
		'<h3><a href="globe-demos/globe02/globe-black-shaders-stars-flags.html">data globe #2</a></h3>' +
		
		'<p>2013-02-15 ~ Another globe, this time mostly black - with better stars. ' +
		'Note the highlighting that occurs near the rim - this was accomplished with the addition of shaders. ' +
		'City flags have been added to help identify the location more quickly. ' +
		'The question that still needs answering is can a globe be used to visualize data or is a globe merely a handy navigation tool?</p>' +
		
		'<h3><a href="globe-demos/globe01/globe-plus-planes-curved.html" target="_blank">data globe #1</a></h3>' +
		
		'<p>2013-02-13 ~ Anything to do with global transportation data kind of must have an image of a globe associated with it. ' +
		'The benefit is that most everybody knows what a globe is for and where their place is on the globe. ' +
		'On the other hand, a globe is a tired old theme and certainly not a great tool for displaying multivariate data. ' +
		'So one idea is to develop some new concepts for what could be termed a \'data globe\'.' +
		'The above link is the equivalent of a preliminary rough sketch. Most of the proposed effects are not yet coded. ' +
		'The idea is that as you moved over the map, certain places would bubble out. They would come to you rather than you having to go there. ' +
		'Think of a magnifying glass or the navigation bar on a Macintosh computer. ' +
		'One aspect of the \'bubble\' that will be fun to explore is the spreading out of the data as it bubbles out. ' +
		'This will make it easier for you to tap on an individual data point to find out more about it. ' +
		'Another possibility that is not yet viewable, is the addition of shadows to help indicate the time of day for particular locations on the globe. ' +
		'In any case, this is just the start. Who knows where this will end. ' +
		'Perhaps you will be able to drag and drop cities on top of one another to compare them...' +

		'The first Geneva file will likely crash your browser. A second smaller version has been added. ' +
		'Once the second menu appears, be careful about clicking on the times and trip IDs - the volume of items can freeze your browser. '+
		'When this happens prepared to close the tab and start over. '+
		'Most testing has been done with the San Francisco real-time-arrivals file. ' +
