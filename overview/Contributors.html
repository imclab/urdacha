	<h2>Urban Data Challenge - Ur-Da-Cha.</h2> Or, as some would say, Your Russian County Home. Bringing together data wranglers, computer software experts, and urban planning enthousiasts together. Had you biked around London in the 70s, you might have run into Tim or Theo. If you bike around SF or Oakland these days, you might run into any of us!</p>

Cynthia's role in Urdacha is that of Project Manager - establishing the course, getting things done, and giving pep talks.</p>
