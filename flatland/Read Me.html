	<h1>flatLand ~ Read Me</h1>
	
	<p>These 'maps' load all San Francisco stops and every current vehicle positions and movement directly off the Nextbus web site. 
	For the moment the presentation is highly abstracted: There is a semi-transparent surface, with stops positioned under the surface and buses above. 

<p> Future edits that would improve the readability and use of the map: 
	<ul>
<li>Indicate bus directions</li>
<li>Built-in updating</li>
<li>Display stops and buses for any of the 20+ Nexbus agencies</li>
<li>Mouse over a bus or stop will display heads-up particulars</li>
<li>Replay the day's schedule - 24 hours in a minute or two</li>
<li>Shadows - to indicate current time of day</li>
<li>Performance improvements and bug fixes</li>
</ul>
</p>
