	<h1>flatLand ~ Read Me</h1>
	
	<p>These 'maps' load all San Francisco stops and every current vehicle positions and headings directly off the Nextbus web site. 
	For the moment the presentation is highly abstracted. There is a semi-transparent surface. Stops are positioned under the surface. 
	Buses are place above the surface. There is no indication, as yet, as to the direction the bus is heading. 
	Nor is there any built-in updating. Both these feature will be in by this weekend. Other likely candidate feature likely to make it in by thus weekend include:

	<ul>
<li>Display stops and buses for any of the 20+ Nexbus agencies</li>
<li>Mouse over a bus or stop will display heads-up particulars</li>
<li>Replay the day's schedule - 24 hours in a minute or two</li>
<li>Shadows - to indicate current time of day</li>
<li>Performance improvements and bug fixes</li>
</ul>
