	<p>It may take a minute or so for your browser to download the data. Look for the 'Ajax Responses' to reach at least 60,000. If you download the data file and app, the two will load in a few seconds. With Tim's help we can most likely get this all working a bit faster.</p>

<p>It takes only about five minutes to replay the entire week/500,000+ lines of San Francisco data. This could be sped up but with likely loss of viewability. There are many things yet to be done. For example, there should be a way of relating the data points to similar data points - such as connecting all the points of a single bus running along a route. A color coding system needs to be added. The San Francisco color system is impractical because several routes use the same color. A permalink feature is needed so that when you observe an interesting pattern you can save that pattern as a link for others to observe. Currently there is minimal lighting and shading. While not particularly necessary here, at least a bit more shading would make the 'feel' a bit better. As always, a number of bugs were fixed and a lot of lines of code were cleaned, but then new bugs appeared and and so did messiness.</p>
