	<h1>hAxis ~ Read Me</h1>

<h2>hAxis = hackathon + Axis</h2>

<p>Want to see for yourself what hAxis can do? This Read Me file provides some basic information to help you navigate the program. </p>

<p>Must have a WebGL enabled machine to work hAxis - preferably using recent releases of Chrome or Firefox on a professional workstation or laptop. Tablets, most phones and Internet Explorer are not WebGL friendly. </p>

<p>Please note that it takes a couple of seconds for the data to load. Thank you for your patience and happy data wrangling! </p>

<h2>Status Menu</h2>
<p>General information on what is appearing on your screen - location, time, date and data set info.</p> 

<h2>Settings Menu</h2>
<p>Allows you to manage all the different layers appearing on the screen. </p>

<p>At the top, select a city and day to replay data from. The Replay Speed bar allows you to adjust the speed of the data being brought out. The Field of View bar allows you to adjust the angle and distortion of the visualization. The Start Line allows you to set the hAxis start point in terms of lines of data and time of day. </p>

<p>Now, the fun part: choosing the z, y and z axis. Ever wonder how the number of passenger on specific routes changed throughout a day? How about looking at the time spent between passenger on and off on a certain bus? How about comparing these numbers throughout a whole city? And then comparing what you have just seen with another city on the other side of the world?! hAxis is the tool that enables you to do so. </p>

<p>Once you have selected all of this information, select what type of information you would like the colors and lines to highlight. If you have a final visualization you would like to save or share with someone, the permalink button captures these settings and opens up a new tab. Click reset permalink to return to the original settings, and reset view to return to the original view. </p>

<h2>Readout Menu</h2>
<p>The Readout Bar provides detailed information regarding the points on the map. This detailed information comes in the form of specific amounts of lines per data point, i.e. how many lines in the file correspond to this specific coordinate? </p>

<p>So, if we are for example looking at a map with Longitude as the Z axis, Latitude as the X axis and route number as the Y axis, the Readout shows you how many buses stopped at an exact point of space, as well as how many stops were made per route throughout the day.
